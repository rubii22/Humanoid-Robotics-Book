# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — From Digital Brain to Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed to teach you how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines.

## What You'll Learn

In this book, you will:

- Master the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture specifically for humanoid robotics
- Create realistic simulation environments using Gazebo and Unity
- Integrate NVIDIA Isaac tools for advanced perception and control
- Build Vision-Language-Action pipelines that process voice commands into robot actions
- Develop a complete voice-driven autonomous humanoid robot

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:

- Senior AI/ML students learning robotics
- Engineers new to embodied intelligence
- Educators building Physical-AI courses

## Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux/Ubuntu environment
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Hardware Requirements

For the best learning experience, we recommend:

- **Minimum**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, 16GB RAM, GTX 1060 or equivalent
- **Recommended**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, 64GB RAM, RTX 4070Ti or better
- **Edge Kit**: Jetson Orin Nano/NX (8GB/16GB), Intel RealSense D435i/D455, USB mic array

## Getting Started

This book is organized into four core modules plus a capstone project:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Create realistic simulation environments
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Integrate perception and navigation
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Pipelines** - Build voice-controlled robot systems
5. **Capstone: Voice-Driven Autonomous Humanoid** - Combine all concepts into a complete system

Each module builds upon the previous ones, but they are designed to be as independent as possible for flexible learning.

Let's begin our journey into Physical AI and embodied intelligence!
